	-- Exercise : 

	In this exercise, you will use the 'movie_db' database.

	- Step 1 :
		Create two pages: 'new-movie.html' and 'insert-movie.php'
	
	- Step 2: 'new-movie.html' should contain a form to insert a new movie.
		You should create all the necessary inputs (title, views....).

		For now, the director id should be an input:number and you can enter the id manually.
		
	- Step 3 :
		When clicking on submit button you must do an AJAX call to the 'insert-movie.php' file.
		In this file, just grab the data coming from the form and display them.

		Once you displayed them in PHP, you know it works and can continue.
	
	- Step 4 :

		This script will now check if all the inputs are valid.
		If there is a problem with the form display an error message (color red)
		If everything went fine, display a success message (color green)

	- Step 5 :
		If everything is ok, try to create the query to insert in the DB.
		Try to execute the query and check if it works !

		CONGRATZ, YOU'VE USED AJAX TO INSERT IN THE DATABASE !
