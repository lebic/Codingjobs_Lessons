/*
	-- Exercise : 

	In this exercise, you will use the 'moviedb' database.

	Create a new file called 'search.html'.
		In this file, create a form with only one input (search textbox).
		This input will be use to search for a movie.
		
		Each time the user press a key, results are shown on the page (similar to auto completion).

    To achieve this you should create a php file ('search-movie.php'). 
		This PHP file looks for a movie with specific characters and return an array of movies.
