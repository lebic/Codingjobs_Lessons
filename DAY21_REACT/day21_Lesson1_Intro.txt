INTRO TO JSX - REACT
https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html


Warning:

Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than to HTML, React DOM uses camelCase property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names.

For example, class becomes className in JSX, and tabindex becomes tabIndex.

-POSSIBLE:

const element = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>Good to see you here.</h2>
